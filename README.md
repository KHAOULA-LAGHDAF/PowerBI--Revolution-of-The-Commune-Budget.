# üìä Power BI: Revolution of the Commune Budget (2007-2015)

This project analyzes the economic evolution of a commune between 2007 and 2015 using Power BI. It showcases the process of data extraction, transformation, modeling, and visualization to uncover key insights from various datasets.

## üìú Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to analyze and visualize the economic data of a commune, covering:

*   Data extraction and connection using Power BI.
*   Data transformation and cleaning with Power Query.
*   Data modeling through relationship management.
*   Data analysis with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures.
*   Creation of interactive dashboards to display insights.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Power BI Integration:** Connects to data sources using Power BI.
*   **Power Query Transformation:** Cleans and transforms data with Power Query.
*   **Relational Modeling:** Manages relationships between tables for analysis.
*   **DAX Measures:** Creates custom measures for detailed analysis.
*   **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualizes data using interactive dashboards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Analysis Pipeline

1.  **Power BI Connection:**
    *   Establishes a connection between Power BI and the SQL Server database.
    *   Selects the database tables relevant for analysis.
